# Three_Marbles
A small Desktop marble game. 








Experience by Ludovico Einaudi has become a very popular song on the internet. I found some 
of his other songs during development of this project, and their names fit the level art 
quite well. I couldn't code the songs into the game as background music because they're not 
public domain, but they can be played freely on YouTube.
