# Three_Marbles
A small Desktop marble game. 

I made this to post it to Steam for a profit. That didn't quite work out, but I still want it
visible, so I posted it here. I spent too long on little algorithmic problems to conceal the 
source code, and always planned to open source it. However, I do eventually want to take 
another try at selling the completed game, so I don't want to Unlicense it here (even if it's 
unfinished). 

All of the heavy lifting is done. The two notable problems left are RCEdit for a Windows dock
icon, and the language translation. I was unable to get a human Mandarin speaker to translate 
the proper english text (not the British joke or the Google Translate joke) before I realized 
posting this to Steam wouldn't work out. 

The Custom Level is a great place to come up with particle art. If you come up with your own, 
I'd love to see it. I've provided the C++ helper programs that printed the spirals in the 
hard-coded levels. 


Here's a funny story: In order to legally sell things under Know Your Customer, you must 
provide either your personal Social-Security Number or an LLC's EIN number. I refuse to give 
up my SSN for exactly this sort of reason, and everybody advises to set up an LLC. However, 
the annual cost of someone to keep track of your LLC's financial operation and keep you out 
of trouble with fraud, is indeed greater than the income I expect from this game. So it's at 
an impass. 

I'm glad I did it, learned a lot about algorithmic problem-solving, started learning a whole 
new game engine, finally got to see BOIDs on my own computer, learned a hard lesson about 
(in this case self-inflicted) crunch, etc. 



The flocking marbles wouldn't have been possible without:

Experience by Ludovico Einaudi has become a very popular song on the internet. I found some 
of his other songs during development of this project, and their names fit the level art 
quite well. I couldn't code the songs into the game as background music because they're not 
public domain, but they can be played freely on YouTube.
